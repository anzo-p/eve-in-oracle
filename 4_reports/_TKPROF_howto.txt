# To find out much interesting about SQL performance…

# 1 first need to run this with appropriate privileges in eg. SQLDeveloper Worksheet
# BEGIN EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET SQL_TRACE = TRUE'; END; --TRUE FALSE

# 2 then execute your SQLs

# 3 then navigate to those trace files
cd /u01/app/oracle/diag/rdbms/orcl/orcl/trace/
# save this file here for guidance in case you happen to return here only much later

# 4 then make the tracefile (*.trc) human readable
# the filename is just to stand out and that underscore ’_’ will place output file first = easy to find
tkprof [trace file] _latest.emacs
